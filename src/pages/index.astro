                <p>
                    I'm a <span class="text-primary-600 dark:text-slate-50">full stack software engineer</span> with
                    expertise throughout the Software Development Lifecycle; from requirements
                    gathering, system's design and UI/UX design, through to implementation
                    and deployment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My primary passion is <span class="text-primary-600 dark:text-slate-50"
                        >game design and development</span
                    > but I honestly just love to solve problems and learn new things along
                    the way. I've always enjoyed learning and that drives me to incorporate
                    a mindset of <span class="text-primary-600 dark:text-slate-50"
                        >continuous self-improvement</span
                    >, and as such I've accrued a lot of varied experience over my <span
                        class="text-primary-600 dark:text-slate-50">{yearsOfExperience} years</span
                    > as a software engineer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-primary-600 dark:text-slate-50">I've always been interested in design.</span
                    > At a young age I started trying to break down gameplay systems and
                    mechanics from video games in order to try and understand how games are
                    constructed and why certain decisions may have been made by their creators.
                    This also bled in to thinking about <span class="text-primary-600 dark:text-slate-50"
                        >how user's interact and interface with products</span
                    > in general and in my career always revel the opportunity to work with
                    designers and artists to talk and learn about UX and design in general.
